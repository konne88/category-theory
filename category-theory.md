When Bartosz Milewski says [Category Theory for Programmers][http://bartoszmilewski.com/2014/10/28/category-theory-for-programmers-the-preface/], he really means it. His explanations include C++ and Java examples (and obviously also Haskell). So far it looks pretty good to me.

"Category Theory for the Working Mathematician", by Saunders Mac Lane is the standard reference for category theory, though said to be very theoretical.

The book starts out by motivating category theory which pictorial definitions:

> Category theory starts with the observation that many properties ... can be unified and simplified by a presentation with diagrams of arrows.

There are many implementations of Category Theory in Coq. One of them is by Jason Gross, "Experience Implementing a Performant Category-Theory Library in Coq".

Pierce wrote in 1988 "A taste of category theory for computer scientists". I haven't read much of it, but I'm not sure how good it is.

Steve Awodey's book "Category Theory" is highly recommended by many.
